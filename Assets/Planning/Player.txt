Movement calculations
how to handle crouching: two different capsule objects with their own camera heads and sizes
Need to prevent phasing through planes: raycast across next position calculated using current velocity
current velocity is modified by acceleration values
moving changes velocity, increasing by acceleration until max speed is reached. Normal movement max speed is seperate from actual speed limit
jump sets velocity and acceleration
Camera should rotate around pill
